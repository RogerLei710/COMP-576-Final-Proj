# COMP-576-Final-Proj

In this repo, we devised two __black box attacks__ variants by introducing two novel data augmentation techniques in generating the training data of the substitute model -- Jacobian-based Dataset Augmentation and traditional image Dataset Augmentation. Jacobian-based Dataset Augmentation has more intuitive geometric meaning. Traditional image Dataset Augmentation requires much fewer queries to the target model.
